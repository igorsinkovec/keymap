Keyboard mappings


Workman

Adapted from O.J. Bucao's Workman layout which was optimised for English


Programmer's Workman, Simplified, with Eastern European letters

simplified so that some characters which haven't been moved very far related to QWERTY remain in their original positions as on QWERTY
specifically: X, C, V

put Eastern European characters on levels 3 and 4 in their original positions as on QWERTZ

put brackets, braces and some very often used characters on the index finger postions on level 3, specifically: {}()%&<>[]?/

etc


work in progress
